# HTML Project - Coffee shop website

## Build a Basic Restaurant Website Using HTML

### Project Overview:

Your task is to create a simple, yet well-structured website for a restaurant or café using only HTML. The project will help you apply the HTML concepts you've learned, focusing on best practices, proper use of semantic elements, and accessible content structure.

### Project Requirements:

You are required to create a three-page website for a fictional restaurant or café. The website should include the following pages:

1. **Home Page (index.html):**
    - **About Us Section:** A brief description of the restaurant/café.
    - **Menu Section:** A table listing various food or drink items available, including their prices and sizes.
    - **Navigation Bar:** Links to the other pages (Timings, Contact Us).
    - **Header Image:** A welcoming image related to your restaurant.
    - **Footer:** Include a footer with copyright information.
2. **Timings Page (timings.html):**
    - **Opening Hours:** Use a definition list (`<dl>`) to display the opening hours for weekdays and weekends.
    - **Navigation Bar:** Links to the other pages (Home, Contact Us).
    - **Header Image:** An image related to your restaurant’s opening hours.
    - **Footer:** Include a footer with copyright information.
3. **Contact Page (contact.html):**
    - **Contact Form:** A form for customers to send a message, including fields for name, email, reason for contact, and a message box.
    - **Google Map Embed:** Embed a Google Map showing the location of the restaurant.
    - **Navigation Bar:** Links to the other pages (Home, Timings).
    - **Header Image:** An image related to contacting your restaurant.
    - **Footer:** Include a footer with copyright information.

### Guidelines:

- **Structure:** Make sure each page has a proper structure using `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` tags.
- **Semantics:** Use appropriate HTML elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<aside>` to ensure your content is semantic.
- **Accessibility:** Include `alt` attributes for images and ensure your form elements have `label` tags associated with them.
- **Links and Navigation:** Ensure all internal links are functional and navigate correctly between the pages.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in the layout and structure across all pages.
- **Meta Tags:** Include basic meta tags in the `<head>` section of each page for character encoding, author, and description.
- **Best Practices:** Follow best practices such as using `<strong>` for emphasizing important text, `<time>` for dates and times, and avoiding deprecated tags.

### Additional Instructions:

- You are allowed to customize the content and images according to your chosen theme (e.g., a pizzeria, bakery, or café). However, the overall structure should remain as specified.
- Do not use CSS or JavaScript. This project focuses solely on HTML.
